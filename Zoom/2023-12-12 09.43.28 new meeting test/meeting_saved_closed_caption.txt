Democracy is at stake as states pass voter suppression laws that target black communities. With an on-the-ground presence in all 50 states, DC and Puerto Rico, the ACLU is taking these attacks head-on.

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:31:51
Ukraine's president, Vladimir Zelensky. Has made a rare trip to Washington this week.

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:31:56
Pleading his case for a American military hate. Long a lifeline for his country. But now, increasingly in doubt.

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:32:05
Today. My colleague Julian Barnes on what has brought Ukraine to its most perilous point since the war began nearly 2 years ago.

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:32:22
It's Tuesday. December 12.

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:32:28
So Julian, you've been following the war in Ukraine, which is kind of the other war that's been happening in the world.

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:32:34
And today we're going to talk about how that war has not only continued but really has reached a critical point.

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:32:43
One in which the United States plays a very important role. So tell me what's happening. This is a real important moment for Ukraine.

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:32:53
It might be the most dangerous since the war first began. And there's a reason for that. Mr. President, the question before the Senate today is simple.

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:33:02
Yet momentous. The American funding for Ukraine hangs in the balance. At stake is America's safety.

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:33:11
The safety of democracy. The future of the war in Ukraine. Last week there was an important Senate vote that would have provided 50 billion dollars more for Ukraine.

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:33:26
This would have taken them through next year. My Democratic colleagues support security for Ukraine. But what they won't support is basic border security for the United States of America.

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:33:40
The Republican opposition to this is growing. There will never be a bill I'll vote for. To help other countries who are very deserving until we control our own border that's completely broken.

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:33:53
There are lawmakers who want to spend the money at home, not, you know, overseas war that they think is going badly.

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:34:01
Mr. Sullivan, no. Mr. Paul, no. Ms. Murkowski, no.

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:34:07
But it's failed. On this vote, the Yays are 49. The nays are 51.

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:34:12
That failed by a single vote. The motion is not agreed to. The Senate stands adjourned until 10 am tomorrow.

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:34:26
If this funding does not come through. Ukraine will lose the war. And we can see how grave those steaks.

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:34:36
Are because today, President Zelensky of Ukraine is in Washington making the case.

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:34:43
For more money making the case for

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:34:46
US support. So Julian let's unpack this here. Let's talk about where we actually are in the war right now.

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:34:58
We left off back in June when we did an episode about the much vaunted counteroffensive the Ukrainians were undertaking.

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:34:59
And the Ukrainians were trying to prove that they could actually go on the offensive, take territory, not just defend it from the Russians.

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:35:08
And perhaps just as important, they were trying to prove to the

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:35:16
Western allies like the United States that the money that those allies were pouring into the war was not in vain.

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:35:19
Remind us what Zelensky said she needed at the time. So the US has provided

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:35:36
Upwards of 75 billion dollars in military and economic aid to Ukraine. And a good chunk of that was what came this year when the US provided armored striker vehicles Bradley fighting vehicles these high Mars rocket art

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:35:50
That could go deep behind Russian lines. That when combined with European

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:35:57
Tanks from Germany and the United Kingdom, we're going to be the backbone of something big.

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:36:03
In addition to the equipment, there became this weeks long effort to use the equipment. We were training 36,000 Ukrainian soldiers in order to make a dramatic new push to push back Russian forces.

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:36:21
So he got all of these weapons. And all of this US training. In the counteroffensive finally began around early last summer.

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:36:29
And now, 6 months later. What's the answer? What happened? Well, it failed.

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:36:36
The counteroffensive failed to achieve the key objectives that Ukraine had laid out. That the US had laid out.

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:36:45
It did not take back major territory that Russia had conquered. Russia still today. Occupies nearly 20% of Ukraine's territory.

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:36:57
And why? Did it fail? Why did this effort to really seize back all of this territory that Russia won in the early months of the war.

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:37:06
Full flat. Well, one reason was the Ukrainian troops were stretched too thin. The Americans really wanted Ukraine to focus their forces in one area to put massive amounts of force in a single location in order to have a dramatic breakthrough.

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:37:28
But the Ukrainians spread it out along a long battle line. And that just meant that for too long, there were too few.

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:37:39
Ukrainian forces. Okay, so Ukraine was stretched all over the country fighting on multiple fronts instead of focused just in one place on one key crucial front that the United States was arguing it should be doing.

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:37:52
What else was going on? Well, Russia also got better. Now, remember, it's easier to be on the defense than on the offense.

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:38:03
In a war. And so Russia had that advantage. But they'd also learn from some of their mistakes and they really focused on improving their defenses and they built these layers of defense these trench lines where they could Keep their troops and in between they put mine upon mine.

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:38:27
We had some of the thickest landmines we've seen since the Korean War. It proved to be an impenetrable defense.

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:38:35
Wow. And then they combine that old technology with a new one. In the air, they put thousands of drones and those drones could spot any movement by the Ukrainians as the Ukrainians came

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:38:51
Field, the Russians would move their forces and they would engage. It kind of lifted the fog of war.

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:38:58
And the Russians were able to react much more quickly than the Americans or the Ukrainians thought they would.

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:39:05
So suddenly the Russians had these kind of x-ray glasses, right? They could see everything the Ukrainians were doing at any given moment because they had all of these drones flying up in the air, which I'm assuming Julian weren't super specialized attack things.

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:39:20
They were just regular kind of out-of-the-box drones. Yeah, these are incredibly simple drones the same thing that you can purchase from your favorite big box store But the important thing is the Ukrainians weren't trained on how to fight.

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:39:37
A war against a thousand cheap drones in the sky. We were training them on an older kind of warfare that it turns out.

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:39:48
Was outmoded. And look, the US for years has tried to train up partner forces in its own image.

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:39:58
Think about Iraq, Afghanistan, even think about Vietnam. And here the US said we are going to teach you Ukraine the basics of what the US calls maneuver warfare, how to use tanks, armored personnel carriers, artillery to have a big effect on the battlefield.

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:40:21
But do you Ukrainians aren't the US? They didn't have all the equipment. Most importantly, they didn't have an Air Force.

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:40:30
When the US brings out its tanks, it also has airplanes in the sky protecting those tanks.

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:40:36
And Ukraine didn't have that. So this all seems to go back to the notion that we had at the very beginning of this war, which is.

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:40:44
If you're a little country. How do you go up against one of the world's? Biggest armies and win.

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:40:52
Moreover, one of the world's biggest armies in a country run by an autocrat. Is okay with having a lot of casualties because for the most part He probably doesn't have to pay a political price for that.

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:41:05
That's right. Russia has a seemingly endless supply of soldiers. They've pushed in these wave attacks that they've taken massive casual

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:41:37
Of people were killed even if Hundreds of pieces of equipment were lost. But President Zelensky push back.

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:41:47
He said you're asking me to take 50% casualty rates even more. And this

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:42:05
Not something any democratic government would do. The US would face real repercussions if they had a military operation that half of the soldiers were lost in.

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:42:06
So it became a political as well as a military problem. What?

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:42:20
Just 2.

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:42:22
Today. The counteroffensive has failed for the most part. Which means that the US and other allies have poured billions of dollars into Ukraine over the course of the past 2 years.

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:42:27
And it didn't work, which must be pretty galling for parts of the US political system, which are not.

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:42:35
Enthusiastic about funny

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:42:40
To begin with. So.

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:42:43
What does all of this mean? For Ukraine vis-a-vis the funding. Nothing good. I mean, who wants to put money into a failing effort?

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:42:48
Who wants to toss good money after wasted money? Okay.

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:42:57
So the big question is how

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:43:02
How are the Ukrainians going to adapt their war strategy? And will it be enough to convince the United States and its allies that Ukraine can

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:43:24
And can turn the tide back in their favor.

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:43:27
We'll be right back.

This is Nik Christoph. I'm an opinion columnist for the New York Times. And I'm proud that for more than a hundred years, the Times has conducted an annual appeal to raise money for charitable organizations.
