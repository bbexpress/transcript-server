Hi, this is the Sunday Read. My name is Kim Tingley and I'm a contributing writer to the New York Times Magazine.

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:58:45
This week's episode is a story of mine from the magazine's recent issue devoted to outer space.

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:58:52
And my stories about what happens to us. To the human body once we leave planet Earth.

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:58:59
Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin went up to space in one. Although we'd sent up animals before.

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:59:07
At that time, we were still really unsure what would happen to people in low gravity. Unsure about even the basics.

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:59:16
Would you be able to swallow? Would you choke on your own tongue? As it turned out, during his 108 min orbit around Earth, You're a good garden could eat and drink just fine.

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:59:30
We learned from his short journey that we could go up there and back. And that some of our basic functions would be OK.

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:59:38
And so, we sent more people up. Farther away and for longer periods of time. First to the moon and later to the International Space Station.

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:59:50
Do you than 700 people have been to space. It may sound like a lot. But it's not enough to draw conclusions.

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:59:57
About what long-term space habitation would do to people. Astronauts have tended to be a pretty homogeneous group.

[Ben Bourgeois] 10:00:05
They're physically fit. They're ultra healthy individuals. And so, they're definitely not a representative sample of the human race.

[Ben Bourgeois] 10:00:15
What we do know is our bodies can adapt pretty quickly to space. At first, you might get a kind of space car sickness, something called space adaptation syndrome.

[Ben Bourgeois] 10:00:27
Which will eventually go away. But then, your body will begin diverting resources away from your bones and muscles because they no longer need to support your weight.

[Ben Bourgeois] 10:00:38
Your blood and other fluids no longer have to fight gravity. So they shift upwards. Your face becomes bloated and you sort of get chicken legs.

[Ben Bourgeois] 10:00:49
The longest anyone's ever been in space is 437 days. But long term, what we don't know is this.

[Ben Bourgeois] 10:00:58
Say that we're out there for years. Would our bodies ever change to the point? When we wouldn't even be able to return to Earth?

[Ben Bourgeois] 10:01:06
And at that point, would we become something else? Entirely?

[Ben Bourgeois] 10:01:13
So here's my article. The bodily indignities of the space life. Read by Julia Whalen.

[Ben Bourgeois] 10:01:21
Our audio producer today is Jack Desedoro. The original music for this episode was written and performed by Aaron Esposito.

[Ben Bourgeois] 10:01:36
As an incubator of life, Earth has a lot going for it, something we often fail to appreciate fully from within its nurturing bounds.

[Ben Bourgeois] 10:01:46
Merely sending probes and rovers to the moon and Mars won't do. For various reasons, adventure, apocalypse, commerce, we insist upon taking our corporeal selves off world too.

[Ben Bourgeois] 10:02:00
Multiple private companies have announced plans to put hotels in space soon. NASA is aiming to threed print lunar neighborhoods within a couple of decades.

[Ben Bourgeois] 10:02:10
And while it will probably take longer than that to build and populate an out Coast on Mars, preparations are being made.

[Ben Bourgeois] 10:02:19
This summer, 4 NASA crew members began a 378 day stay in simulated Martian housing at the Johnson Space Center in Houston.

[Ben Bourgeois] 10:02:30
When you look at the renderings of these cozy dwellings, it's easy to lose sight of how hostile space is to Earthlings.

[Ben Bourgeois] 10:02:38
As a reminder, consider what would happen if you found yourself in low Earth orbit or on Mars or the Moon without a space suit on.

[Ben Bourgeois] 10:02:47
You would pass out from a lack of oxygen within a matter of seconds, a condition known as hypoxia and die soon thereafter.

[Ben Bourgeois] 10:02:54
In the brief meantime all the gases inside your body including any air still in your lungs would expand in the absence of external pressure.

[Ben Bourgeois] 10:03:05
Depressurization would also cause your internal fluids to bubble. Not because they're heating up, but because they are transmogrifying into their gaseous state.

[Ben Bourgeois] 10:03:16
The temperature wouldn't be much of a problem, at least, even though thermometers in low Earth orbit produce readings from minus 85 degrees to 257°F depending on whether they are in shadow or in light.

[Ben Bourgeois] 10:03:30
Space as a near vacuum has very little mass to conduct heat to or away from you, so you are not likely to feel instantly hot or cold.

[Ben Bourgeois] 10:03:41
While hypoxia is potentially a real threat, should your space vessel or extraterrestrial habitat leak, it's a manageable one.

[Ben Bourgeois] 10:03:49
Assuming you haven't leaped naked out of your space capsule or off-world dwelling.

[Ben Bourgeois] 10:03:54
But 2 other major challenges confront our fragile bodies when we leave our planet, neither of which has been entirely solved yet.

[Ben Bourgeois] 10:04:03
Even indoors. Variable gravity. And radiation. Gravity is determined by the mass of objects and their distance from one another.

[Ben Bourgeois] 10:04:15
Because Earth is so big, it is impossible, while on it, to escape its gravity for any serious length of time.

[Ben Bourgeois] 10:04:23
As a result, we don't know very much about what our lives would be like without or under some diminished influence of this omnipresent attraction.

[Ben Bourgeois] 10:04:32
On the moon and on Mars, which are smaller than our world, the gravitational tug will be much less, a sixth and a third respectively of what it is here.

[Ben Bourgeois] 10:04:43
Conversely, radiation exposure intensifies with elevation because there's less atmosphere above you to block it.

[Ben Bourgeois] 10:04:51
And to incur a much larger dose if you get beyond the protective bubble of Earth's ozone and magnetosphere, the magnetic field that stretches roughly 40,000 miles out at its most compressed point.

[Ben Bourgeois] 10:05:04
The solar and galactic radiation that washes over Mars, which at its closest is 34 million miles away, will potentially be 700 times as great as what passes through our magnetic defenses.

[Ben Bourgeois] 10:05:19
Space travelers beyond low Earth orbit will also be bombarded with high-energy atomic nuclei from exploding stars throughout the galaxy, which are normally deflected by the magnetosphere from reaching the surface of our planet.

[Ben Bourgeois] 10:05:34
Those particles are so heavy and moving so fast that they penetrate spaceships, space suits, and skin, banging into other particles in their path and damaging any attendant cells in ways researchers are only beginning to understand.

[Ben Bourgeois] 10:05:51
So far, most of what we know about the effects on the human body of these threats comes from astronauts in low Earth orbit.

[Ben Bourgeois] 10:05:59
And because safety is a paramount concern, we don't send many of them up there. And we don't let them stay for long when we do.

[Ben Bourgeois] 10:06:07
6 months is the average length of a visit to the International Space Station and fewer than 300 people have made the 250 mile voyage.

[Ben Bourgeois] 10:06:17
While that collective experience is enough to have taught us how the body responds when gravity's pull is substantially reduced, The magnetosphere still shields the ISS and only the 24 astronauts who flew in the Apollo program have gone beyond it.

[Ben Bourgeois] 10:06:33
The moon orbits an average of more than 238,000 miles away. Though these 2 dozen astronauts spent little more than a week at a time without its protection, They have died of cardiovascular disease at a rate 4 to 5 times as high as that of their counterparts who stayed in low Earth orbit or never entered orbit at all, which suggests that exposure to cosmic radiation might have damaged their

[Ben Bourgeois] 10:07:02
arteries, veins, and capillaries. We can't send people to Mars or to live on the moon until we can be reasonably confident that they'll survive getting and residing there.

[Ben Bourgeois] 10:07:14
But the space-based medical science needed to make that possible has been hindered by small sample sizes that aren't representative of the general population.

[Ben Bourgeois] 10:07:23
All of the Apollo astronauts were white men born between 1,928 and 1936.

[Ben Bourgeois] 10:07:30
Space tourism, though, promises to offer opportunities to study the effects of radiation and low gravity on a much broader demographic than really well selected super people, as Doree Donnaville, the director of the Translational Research Institute for Space Health.

[Ben Bourgeois] 10:07:48
Trish at the Baylor College of Medicine describes those who have historically qualified to leave the planet.

[Ben Bourgeois] 10:07:55
Old, young, pre-existing health conditions, we are starting to gather a knowledge base that in the future will be essential even for NASA.

[Ben Bourgeois] 10:08:06
Doneville told me. Because we have to learn about the edge cases to really understand what is going on in our bodies to adapt to a hostile environment.

[Ben Bourgeois] 10:08:14
You don't learn as much from people who are healthy. It's when people get sick that you understand how people get sick and how to prevent it.

[Ben Bourgeois] 10:08:23
Epidemiologists face the same predicament on Earth. Before they can figure out how to protect the population, they must wait for harm to come to enough people to expose the causes.

[Ben Bourgeois] 10:08:35
Less rigorous medical screening allows more tourists to reach space, the chances increase significantly that someone will get hurt or have a health emergency there.

[Ben Bourgeois] 10:08:46
Aerospace Medicine is one of 3 specialties certified by the American Board of Preventive Medicine because surgeons for a given flight
