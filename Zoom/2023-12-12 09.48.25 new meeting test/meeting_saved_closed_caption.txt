Our freedoms are under attack. People are traveling hundreds of miles to find abortion care. Transgender kids are banned from accessing critical health care and our democracy is at stake as states pass voter suppression laws that target black communities.

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:45:36
With an on-the-ground presence in all 50 states, DC and Puerto Rico, the ACLU is taking these attacks head-on.

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:45:43
Protect everyone's rights. Donate at ACLU. Org today. From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Taverny speaking, and this is the

Hmm. Argentina. A poster child for economic dysfunction. Is again in the midst of an acute crisis.

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:46:06
Last month set up with liberal fixes Argentines voted for the candidate promising to blow it all up.

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:46:14
Today. My colleague Jack Nickus on Javier The right wing populist now taking office in Argentina.

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:46:23
And his radical plan to remake the country's

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:46:31
It's Monday, December eleventh.

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:46:35
Hmm.

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:46:41
Jack, it's nice to see you again. Thanks for having me. So we are talking today about Argentina and its new president.

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:46:49
Have your malay. He was anaugurated yesterday and he's a pretty. Lamboyant and colorful populist, kind of styled in the vein of Donald Trump.

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:47:00
So tell me about this new president. Well, this was really one of the most surprising elections in Argentina's history.

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:47:07
And from the start, the national conversation was dominated by Javier Millay. So, you have your Millay, so, Economic, the, L, he spent years working as an economist and teaching economics then was elected as a freshman congressman who really didn't show up to Congress much, but really became known to Argentines for many years of TV pungentry.

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:47:30
So, He used to be brought onto these cable news talk shows to be the token conservative voice in a country that has in recent years been pretty left leaning.

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:47:44
And you really stood out for a combative style and opinions that are really outside of the mainstream. El Papa is a representante in Marignolatira.

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:47:54
So for example, he called the pope a communist and the embodiment of evil. And bear in mind the Pope is Argentine and a huge figure in the country.

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:48:04
So This was really controversial. No, So not. And he's also suggested that the left has greatly exaggerated the number of appearances or murders that occurred during the bloody military dictatorship in the 19 seventys and 19 eighties.

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:48:22
And that's struck a lot of people as a troubling sympathy for the country's authoritarian past.

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:48:28
So, so, he's argued that the right is aesthetically and intellectually superior than the left.

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:48:40
He has said climate change is a socialist plot. And in the lead up to his elections, he was peddling baseless claims of voter fraud.

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:48:48
But despite these unusual and to many worrisome politics, the thing that you need to understand about Argentina is that politics is really about economics.

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:49:01
And Millay is the candidate. Promising a sharp break economically. He's pitching voters on a libertarian overhaul of government.

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:49:19
And libertarian meaning that he wants to essentially kind of get the state to get out of the way. Other 3.

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:49:27
What? I'll get them to see. He's trying to argue that the state is a predatory against the average citizen in its policies and taxes, etc.

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:49:41
And these libertarian views would really be a radical departure from what the government and what Argentina has had for decades, essentially.

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:49:49
You know, And so Malay's election victory showed how desperate voters are for change.

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:50:02
Okay.

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:50:09
Okay. So tell me about that desperation. Like, what was it that caused Argentines to elect this political newcomer with these extreme views.

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:50:18
Well, I think anyone who has been vaguely paying attention to Argentina over the past several decades knows that they've been dealing with an economic crisis after economic crisis for a long time and they are currently in one of their worst.

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:50:32
And that's saying something for Argentina. Right now, annual inflation stands at above 140%. Wow.

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:50:39
The Argentine Peso has completely disintegrated in value and just more and more Argentines are falling into poverty.

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:50:45
So what does a hundred 40% inflation look like? Give us a sense of that. Well, it's a situation where the value of the Argentine currency is constantly falling and prices are constantly going up.

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:51:00
So It's a bit confusing to live in Argentina sometimes. I'll give you one example.

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:51:06
Sequuira, Plata, 10, LEAGUE, When I was in Buenos Aires recently, I met this owner of a hardware store called Oscar Benitez.

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:51:15
His store is this really lovely little kind of almost tiny walking closet in the way. But. Covered in products

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:51:23
Hinges and locks, but he doesn't know the price really of any of them. Because of the fact that The pesos value is falling so quickly and prices are rising so quickly.

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:51:39
And when someone wants to buy something. He has to go to his computer to look at a list that the supplier provides to him, which is constantly updating with new prices.

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:51:49
So how often does he have to do this? Concate frequency, how often do you have to change?

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:52:10
He was depressed and you know kind of had a lot of gals humor about the situation. I've got a lot of gall's humor about the situation I've got.

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:52:25
1 point called the Argentine Peso use toilet paper and as a result he has tried to find ways to cope.

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:52:31
What does he do when he gets money? It, he buys for. It.

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:52:39
Yeah, yeah, because they, you know, when he gets pesos, he's tries to get rid of them as quickly as possible so they don't lose any more value.

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:52:46
So He either goes and buys more products and supplies. He has way more than he really needs, but he feels they hold value better than the peso or He buys US dollars.

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:52:58
So he's basically trying to preserve the value of the money that he has by going out and buying dollars.

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:53:04
Exactly. And Argentines for many

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:53:09
Many years.

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:53:09
Now have flocked to dolls.

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:53:14
Models to

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:53:17
Their rally to save their money. As a result, more than 200 billion dollars. In hard US currency is now in Argentina.

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:53:22
And that means that on a per capita basis, Argentines hold more banknotes, US bank notes, than Americans.

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:53:31
Anybody who has bought a house.

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:53:36
No.

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:53:36
That they almost certainly bought it in $100 bills. Okay, so Argentines have a lot of American dollars, which is of course a bad sign for their economy, reminds me a lot of Russia in the 19 nineties when also the rubble was just going wild and losing value.

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:53:49
People used dollars to buy big important things.

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:53:58
Was a communist economy.

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:54:03
Going into the global one. What is it here? What caused this in Argentina? Well, it's a long story, but the short story is that it's really just decades of deep.

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:54:07
Economic mismanagement. A series of left leaning governments has expanded the social safety net with things like

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:54:16
Free health care.

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:54:21
Universities, a dramatic expansion of social programs, deep subsidies for energy and public transportation, big pensions.

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:54:23
And all of that without much. Economic revenue to pay for it. But to make up for that shortfall, they have drained economic reserves.

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:54:31
They have taken out massive international debt. And also just printed more money and that has left the peso much less valuable and prices skyrocketing.

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:54:42
Which brings us to Mr. Millay. So what are the specifics of what he's proposing, Jack?

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:54:50
I mean, what's his economic plan exactly? Well, he wants to take Argentina in a completely different direction.

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:54:56
So specifically he wants to drastically shrink the size of government. He wants to eliminate 10 of the government's 18 ministries.

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:55:04
He has proposed privatizing the state airline, the railroad company, the state oil company, and really trying to remake the Argentine government in Argentina itself in his libertarian view of the world.

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:55:19
And that also means some much more radical ideas.

[Ben Bourgeois] 09:55:33
Hmm.
